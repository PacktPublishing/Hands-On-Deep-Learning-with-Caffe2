# Hands-On Deep Learning with Caffe2 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Deep Learning with Caffe2 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-deep-learning-caffe2-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788625814), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
All classes in this course are hands-on; you will get sufficient background about each class's content, and you will then go through critical examples that you need to know. At the end of each to, you will also be presented with quizzes to help you master Caffe2.
